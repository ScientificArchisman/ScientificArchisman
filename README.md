### Hi there <img src = "https://github.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/blob/master/wave.gif?raw=true" width = "30px">, I am Archisman Chakraborti

---

I am currently a **physics** student doing my undergraduate studies. 

I am moderately experienced with Python and  am dabbling in the fields of **Machine Learning and Deep learning** (especially Convolutional Neural Networks) for my work.

Alongside this, my recent interests in the the world of coding have spiked in web development and am in the midst of playing with the 3 most popular languages in web development - **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**

I like to create simulations of real life **physical systems** and visualise them with various visualisation tools.
Currently, I am working on a few research papers alongside Microbiologists. My work mainly includes data analysis and designing of models to fit various physical systems as presented by practical experiments.
