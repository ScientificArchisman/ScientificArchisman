### Hi there <img src = "https://github.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/blob/master/wave.gif?raw=true" width = "30px">, I am Archisman Chakraborti

---

I am currently a Physics student doing my undergraduate studies. 

I am moderately experienced with Python and dabbling in the fields of Machine Learning and Deep learning (especially Convolutional Neural Networks) for my work.

I like to create simulations of real life physical systems and visualise them with various visualisation tools.
Currently, I am working on a few research papers alongside Microbiologists. My work mainly includes data analysis and designing of models to fit various physical systems as presented by practical experiments.
